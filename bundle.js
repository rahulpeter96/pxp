(&ldquo;<strong>Nuage</strong>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<strong>we</strong>,&rdquo; &ldquo;<strong>our</strong>,&rdquo; or &ldquo;<strong>us</strong>&rdquo;). These Terms of Service govern your use of the Nuage website and the software and services made available there, as well as any other websites, subdomains, or services owned or controlled by Nuage (collectively, the &ldquo;<strong>Service</strong>&rdquo;). To access the Service, users must at all times agree to and abide by these Terms. The Service allows you to submit, store, and access certain business data and other information related to you, your Subscription Organization (defined below), and/or your and/or their business, primarily relating to your domain name registrations (collectively, &ldquo;<strong>Customer Data</strong>&rdquo;).</p>\n\n            <p>This Terms of Service for the Service is a legal contract between you, either an individual subscriber, customer, member, or user of at least 18 years of age or a single company, organization, or entity (&ldquo;<strong>you</strong>&rdquo; or, collectively with other users, &ldquo;<strong>Users</strong>&rdquo;) and Nuage regarding your use of the Service. Nuage may have different roles with respect to different types of Users, and &ldquo;you&rdquo; as used in these Terms will apply to the appropriate type of User under the circumstances.</p>\n\n            <p>Please read carefully the following terms of service. By registering for and/or accessing, browsing, using or subscribing to the Service, or by clicking &ldquo;I Agree,&rdquo; or otherwise affirmatively manifesting your intent to be bound by these Terms of Service, you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the following terms, including any additional guidelines and any future modifications (collectively, the &ldquo;<strong>Terms</strong>&rdquo;), and to the collection and use of your personal information as set forth in the Nuage Privacy Policy https://www.nuageapp.com/privacy.</p>\n\n            <p>If you are using or opening an account with Nuage on behalf of a company, entity, or organization (collectively, the &ldquo;<strong>Subscribing Organization</strong>&rdquo;) then you represent and warrant that you: (i) are an authorized representative of that entity with the authority to bind such entity to these Terms; (ii) have read these Terms; (iii) understand these Terms, and (iv) agree to these Terms on behalf of such Subscribing Organization.</p>\n\n            <p>Please read these Terms carefully to ensure that you understand each provision. This Agreement contains a mandatory individual arbitration and class action/jury trial waiver provision that requires the use of arbitration on an individual basis to resolve disputes, rather than jury trials or class actions.</p>\n\n            <ol>\n            \t<li><strong>1. License Grant</strong>. Subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms,&nbsp;Nuage hereby grants to you a limited, personal, non-transferable license to use the Service in the manner contemplated by these Terms solely for your internal business purposes. Users shall have no right to sub-license or resell the&nbsp;Service or any component thereof.</li>\n            \t<li><strong>2. Privacy</strong>. User privacy is important to us. Please read our Privacy Policy https://www.nuageapp.com/privacy carefully for details relating to the collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information.</li>\n            \t<li><strong>3. Individual Features and Services</strong>. Certain features of the Service (&ldquo;<strong>Individual Services</strong>&rdquo;) may have their own terms and conditions that you must agree to when you sign up for that particular product, function, or service (each an &ldquo;<strong>Individual Service Agreement</strong>&rdquo;). An Individual Service Agreement supplements these Terms and is hereby incorporated by reference. If any term of these Terms expressly conflicts with any term of an Individual Service Agreement, the conflicting term in the Individual Service Agreement will control. All other terms and conditions of each agreement will remain in full force and effect. Further, you will be subject to any additional posted guidelines or rules applicable to specific services and features which may be posted from time to time (the &ldquo;<strong>Guidelines</strong>&rdquo;). All such Guidelines are hereby incorporated by reference into the Terms.</li>\n            \t<li><strong>4. Modification of the Terms</strong>. Nuage reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of these Terms at any time. You agree to review these Terms and any Guidelines periodically for changes. When we change the Terms in a material manner, we will update the &lsquo;last modified&rsquo; date at the top of this page and notify you that material changes have been made to these Terms. If any such revision is unacceptable to you, your only remedy is to terminate your Nuage User Account.</li>\n            \t<li><strong>5. Eligibility; Termination</strong>. The Service is not available to persons under 18 years of age or to any Users previously suspended or removed from the Service by Nuage. Nuage may terminate your account, delete any content or information that you have posted on the Service, and/or prohibit you from using or accessing the Services (or any portion, aspect, or feature of the Services) for any reason or no reason, at any time in its sole discretion, with or without notice, including without limitation if it believes that you are under 18.</li>\n            \t<li>You agree that Nuage, in its sole discretion and for any or no reason, may terminate any account (or any part thereof) you may have with Nuage. In addition, Nuage reserves the right to discontinue any aspect of the Service at any time, including the right to discontinue the display of any Customer Data. You agree that any termination of your access to the Service or any account you may have or portion thereof may be affected without prior notice, and you agree that Nuage will not be liable to you or any third-party for such termination. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive, or illegal activity that may be grounds for termination of your use of the Service may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities. These remedies are in addition to any other remedies Nuage may have at law or in equity.</li>\n            \t<li><strong>6. Account Activity Responsibility</strong>\n            \t<ol>\n            \t\t<li><strong>6.1. User Accounts</strong>. In order to use certain aspects of the Service, you will have to register for the Service and create an account (&ldquo;<strong>User Account</strong>&rdquo;). When creating your account for the Service, you agree to provide true, accurate, current, and complete information. You further agree to maintain and update your personal information as needed to keep it true, accurate, current, and complete. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password and for restricting access to your computer, and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password. If you have reason to believe that your account is no longer secure (for example, in the event of a loss, theft or unauthorized disclosure or use of your ID, password, or any credit, debit or charge card number), you agree to immediately notify Nuage. You may be liable for the losses incurred by Nuage or others due to any unauthorized use of your User Account.</li>\n            \t\t<li><strong>6.2. Administrator Accounts</strong>. The person who first completes the Service registration on behalf of any Subscribing Organization is the initial &ldquo;Administrator&rdquo; for purposes of such Subscribing Organization&rsquo;s use of the Service, and exercises certain options to initially determine the level of access, privacy, and security for the Service related to the Subscribing Organization (&ldquo;<strong>Administrator Account</strong>&rdquo;). For example, the Administrator will determine who can be a User of the Service under the organization associated with that Administrator and Subscribing Organization and the level of privileges that such Users will possess. Once initial registration has been completed, each Subscribing Organization will be able to register additional Administrators. Each Administrator may designate other Users as additional and/or successor Administrators, and is responsible for confirming that those person(s) accept such responsibility. Upon becoming an Administrator, each person will be deemed to agree to the obligations hereunder. In addition, any person designated as the billing contact in the Service billing record for a Subscribing Organization will be deemed to assume the rights and obligations of an Administrator. Administrator Accounts must comply in all respects with all terms and conditions applicable to User Accounts.</li>\n            \t\t<li><strong>6.3. System Access</strong>. You may choose to allow Nuage to automatically retrieve data from your system(s) or third-party systems or services on your behalf. You hereby represent and warrant that you have the permission, authority, and rights to allow Nuage to so automatically access such system(s) and services and you hereby grant Nuage permission to access such system(s) and services and retrieve Customer Data therefrom by indicating the same within your User Account. Nuage disclaims any and all liability associated with accessing and retrieving Customer Data from such system(s) and services on your or your Subscribing Organization&rsquo;s behalf. In order to connect the Service with any third-party service, you hereby designate Nuage as your agent and attorney-in-fact in connection with such service and further authorize us to: (a) store your Customer Data relating to such service; (b) access such service using Customer Data you provide us; (c) use any materials you provide us in order to provide you the Service; (d) gather and export from such service any Customer Data reasonably necessary for us to provide the Service to you; and (e) otherwise take any action in connection with such service as is reasonably necessary for us to provide the Service to you. You agree that those third-party service providers are entitled to rely on the foregoing authorization, agency, and power of attorney granted by you. If at any time you do not have the right and authority to allow Nuage automatic access to such system(s), then you hereby agree to immediately disable such functionality within your User or Administrator Account.</li>\n            \t\t<li><strong>6.4. Account Information</strong>. You acknowledge and agree that Nuage may access, preserve and disclose your account information and related contents if required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal process; (b) enforce these Terms; (c) respond to claims that any Customer Data violates the rights of third parties; (d) respond to your requests for customer service; or (e) protect the rights, property or personal safety of Nuage, its users, or the public.&nbsp;</li>\n            \t</ol>\n            \t</li>\n            \t<li><strong>7.

Unless otherwise stated, all fees are quoted in U.S. Dollars. All payments must be made electronically by the methods specified within the Service. You agree that we may charge your selected payment method for any such fees owed. You are required to keep your billing information current, complete, and accurate (<em>e.g.</em>, a change in billing address, credit card number, or expiration date) and to notify Nuage if your selected payment method is cancelled (<em>e.g.</em>, for loss or theft). All fees and charges are earned upon receipt by us and are nonrefundable (and there are no credits) except (a) as expressly set forth herein, and/or (b) as required by applicable law.</li>\n            \t\t<li><strong>7.2. Charges on Your Account</strong>. You are responsible for all charges incurred under your account made by you or anyone who uses your User Account (including your co-workers, colleagues, team-members, etc.). If your payment method fails or you are past due on amounts owed, we may collect fees owed using other collection mechanisms. Your User Account may be deactivated without notice to you if payment is past due, regardless of the dollar amount. You are also responsible for paying any governmental taxes imposed on your use of the Service, including, but not limited to, sales, use, or value-added taxes. To the extent Nuage is obligated to collect such taxes, the applicable tax will be added to your billing account.</li>\n            \t\t<li><strong>7.3. Payment Authorization</strong>. Authorization to charge your chosen payment method account will remain in effect until you cancel or modify your preferences within the Service; provided, however, that such notice will not affect charges submitted before Nuage could reasonably act. Your charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described when you ordered the applicable service or on the Pricing and Payment Terms <a href="https://www.nuageapp.com/pricing">https://www.nuageapp.com/pricing</a>.&nbsp; You agree that charges may be accumulated as incurred and may be submitted as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of the applicable billing cycle.</li>\n            \t\t<li><strong>7.4. Changes to Fees</strong>. Nuage reserves the right to change the amount of, or basis for determining, any fees or charges for the Service we provide, and to institute new fees, charges, or terms effective upon prior notice to our Users. You will receive notice of any fee change at least five (5) days before the scheduled date of the transaction and failure to cancel your account as set forth herein will constitute acceptance of such fee change. Any changes to fees will apply only on a prospective basis. If you do not agree to any such changes to fees, charges, or terms, your sole remedy is to cancel your subscription. Fees paid for any subscription term are paid in advance and are not refundable in whole or in part. If you have a balance due on any Service account, you agree that Nuage can charge these unpaid fees to any payment method that you have previously provided.&nbsp;</li>\n            \t\t<li><strong>7.5. Automatic Renewals</strong>. Your Service will be automatically renewed and your credit card account (or other payment method account) will be charged as follows without further authorization from you: (a) every month for monthly subscriptions; (b) upon every one (1) year anniversary for annual subscriptions; (c) such other periodic rate you have selected from among the options offered on the Service. You acknowledge that your subscription is subject to automatic renewals and you consent to and accept responsibility for all related recurring charges to your applicable payment method without further authorization from you and without further notice unless required by law. You acknowledge that the amount of the recurring charge may change if the applicable tax rates change or if there has been a change in the applicable fees.</li>\n            \t</ol>\n            \t</li>\n            \t<li><strong>8.

Customer Data</strong>\n            \t<ol>\n            \t\t<li><strong>9.1. Use of Customer Data</strong>. By submitting Customer Data to Nuage, you hereby grant, and represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to grant, all rights and licenses to the Customer Data required for Nuage and its subcontractors and service providers to provide the Service. Nuage shall have no right to sublicense or resell Customer Data, except however, that you agree that Nuage may collect, analyze, and use data derived from Customer Data, which may include Personal Data and/or information collected from or about an individual but which does not identify the individual personally, as well as data about you, and other Users&rsquo; access and use of the Service, for purposes of operating, analyzing, improving, or marketing the Service and any related services. If Nuage shares or publicly discloses information (<em>e.g.</em>, in marketing materials, or in application development) that is derived from Customer Data, such data will be aggregated or anonymized to reasonably avoid identification of a specific individual or the User. By way of example and not limitation, Nuage may: (a) track the number of users on an anonymized aggregate basis as part of Nuage&rsquo;s marketing efforts to publicize the total number of Users of the Service; (b) analyze aggregated usage patterns for product development efforts; or (c) use anonymous data derived from Customer Data in a form which may not reasonably identify either a particular individual or the User to develop further analytic frameworks and application tools. You further agree that Nuage will have the right, both during and after the term of these Terms, to use, store, transmit, distribute, modify, copy, display, sublicense, and create derivative works of the anonymized, aggregated data.</li>\n            \t\t<li><strong>9.2. Your Responsibilities for Customer Data</strong>.
